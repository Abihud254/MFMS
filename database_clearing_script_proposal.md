I have deleted the `chama-backend/scripts/seedDatabase.js` file as you requested, so it will no longer populate your database with test data.

Please note that this action does not automatically clear the existing data from your database. If you want to start with a fresh, empty database, you will need to manually clear it.

Alternatively, I can create a new script for you that will only clear the database without adding any new data.

Would you like me to create a database-clearing script for you?
