I have fixed the 405 error by configuring the Vercel deployment to correctly proxy API requests to your backend server.

Please follow these steps:
1.  Commit the changes to your git repository.
2.  Redeploy your frontend application to Vercel.

After the new version is deployed, the registration form should work correctly.

I have also removed the temporary logging middleware from your backend server code.
